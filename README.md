# Honours Project Repository

Within this repository currently:
* Classification and Regression files/models using supervised learning.
* Game Theory Literature Review (Unf.)

What this repository aims to have:
* Predictive Analytics with Ensemble Learning,
* Pattern Detection with Unsupervised Learning,
* Recommender Systems,
* Heuristic Search Techniques,
* Genetic Algorithms,
* Natural Language Processing,
* Probabilistic Reasoning for Sequential Data,
* Speech Recognition Software,
* Object Detection and Tracking,
* Artificial Neural Networks,
* Reinforcement Learning Techniques,
* Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks.

These will contribute towards an Honours project starting in Sept 2018.

THESE TITLES ARE SOMEWHAT UNOFFICIAL:
Honours Title: "~~Learning to Play: Nash Equilibria in Repeated Games Using Machine Learning and Neural Networks~~" <br/>
2nd Draft Title: "Learning to play: A comparison of effectiveness between different representation of agent cognitions using evolutionary algorithms and machine learning"
