# Honours Project Repository

This repo houses my honours project completed between September 2018 - May 2019. The title of the project is, "A Comparison of Effectiveness Between Different Representations of Agent Cognitions Using Evolutionary Algorithms". The purpose of the project was to find the most effective way of representing a prisoner in the classic 'Prisoner's Dilemma' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma), between finite state machines and neural networks. In the simulations, the computational models will play against each other in various ways, in an attempt to become fitter over the course of a number of generations. The dissertation explores topics such as how this was done, previous work attempted, what went right and what went wrong.
